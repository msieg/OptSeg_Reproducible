# OptSeg_Reproducible

### Description

OptSeg is a tool for optimally segmenting stimuli into matched lists. This GitHub Repo contains a markdown file **OptSeg.md** that allows you to simulate a neuroscience experiment with and without OptSeg. The output of OptSeg.md is **OptSeg.html**, a fully reproducible report that details the results of the experiment. 

### How to run

Simply clone this repo and execute the bash script **run_experiment.sh** from the command line to install the python package requirements and simulate the neuroscience experiment. 

e.g. 

git clone https://github.com/msieg/OptSeg_Reproducible.git

bash run_experiment.sh
